# demo-Journal

## Project Outline
The Daily Journal application will be your opportunity to take the concepts you learn in class, and practice with the exercises and apply them elaboratively throughout the course.

Ultimately the daily journal will display a list of posts with the ability to add, edit, and delete a post.

## My Goals
This evolving project was my way to track my progress/learnings throughout the front-end portion of the course. Each lesson built on each other to build out a useable journal that I could use to note my feelings on the process.
